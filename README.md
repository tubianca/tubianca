- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @tubianca
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in running nodes. It's been 3 years since I met crypto. 
- I have extensive experience in node administration more than 1 year,  
it is possible to host servers in several locations. I generally prefer Hetzner to set my nodes. 

- I run software that keeps a full copy of the blockchain and broadcasts transactions across the network. 
Nodes are needed in order to make blockchains work. I ensures that nodes run with enough resources 
to keep nodes stable and performant.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... kindly click twitter link on my github profile.
